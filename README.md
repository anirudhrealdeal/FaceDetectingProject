# FaceDetectingProject
This is a basic image Processsing project which helps in detecting faces. We extensively use opencv-python and mediapipe. You will learn to draw rectangles and lines using mediapipe.
This can further be used in other mlops or apps. Also we are displaying the accuracy of detection along with it's bounding box information such as the x and y coordinates and the height and width covered by the face on the screen. Happy Coding!!
